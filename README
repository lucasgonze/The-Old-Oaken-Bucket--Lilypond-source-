A fork of http://www.mutopiaproject.org/ftp/KiallmarkGF/oakbucket/oakbucket.ly, which was created by Stan Sanderson. This composition, his code, and my code are in the public domain.

You can hear the original music in barbershop quartet style at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI4ej8b1VeE. More info on the poem at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Woodworth

This is my arrangement.

I clipped off the 2nd two verses so this would fit on one page. See Stan's original or Wikipedia if you want them.
